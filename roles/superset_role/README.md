## Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the role for your Ansible playbook. Once launched, it will install [Apache Superset](https://superset.apache.org/) in a Debian system.

### Prerequisites :ballot_box_with_check:

Ansible 2.9.x.x version installed.
Inventory destination should be a Debian (preferable Debian 10 Buster ) or Ubuntu environment.

‚ÑπÔ∏è By default this role use the predefined installation of Python that comes with the distro.

For testing purposes, [Molecule](https://molecule.readthedocs.io/) with [Docker](https://www.docker.com/) as driver and [Goss](<https://github.com/aelsabbahy/goss>) as verifier.

### Installing :inbox_tray:

Create or add to your roles dependency file (e.g requirements.yml):

```yml
- src: idealista.superset_role
  scm: git
  version: 1.1.0
  name: superset_role
```

Install the role with ansible-galaxy command:

```sh
ansible-galaxy install -p roles -r requirements.yml -f
```

Use in a playbook:

```yml
---
- hosts: someserver
  roles:
    - role: superset_role
```

## Usage :runner:

Look to the defaults properties files to see the possible configuration properties, take a look for them:

- [`main.yml`](./defaults/main/main.yml) for superset general purpose vars.
- [`superset_config.yml`](./defaults/main/superset_config.yml) for all the related superset_config.py config parameters.

üëâ Don't forget :

- ü¶∏ To set your Admin user.
- üîë To set Secret key.
- üîë To set webserver secret key.
- üìù To set your SUPERSET_HOME and SUPERSET_CONFIG_PATH at your own discretion.
- üìù To set your installation and config skelton paths at your own discretion.
  - üëâ See `superset_skeleton_paths` in [`main.yml`](./defaults/main/main.yml)
- ‚öôÔ∏è To customize your app service and superset running config.
- ‚öôÔ∏è To customize your feature flags.
- ‚öôÔ∏è To choose your preferred webdriver version in case of use [alerts & reports](https://superset.apache.org/docs/installation/alerts-reports) for example.
- üêç Python and pip version, and install before if necessary.
- üöô [Custom db drivers](#blue_car-Custom-db-drivers) In addition, superset requires additional drivers to connect to different databases [Supported Databases and Dependecies](https://superset.apache.org/docs/databases/installing-database-drivers).
- üì¶ [Additional Python packages](#package-Additional-Python-packages) with version specific like like python-ldap for example to use LDAP login
- ‚ö†Ô∏è With Airflow v1.10.0, PyPi package `pyasn1` v0.4.4 is needed. See examples below

### :blue_car: Custom db drivers

```

### :package: Additional Python packages
